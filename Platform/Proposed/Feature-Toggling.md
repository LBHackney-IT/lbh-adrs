# Feature Toggling

### **Date:** <*ADR DATE HERE*>

### **Status:** DRAFT | PROPOSED | ACCEPTED | REFUSED | SUPERSEDED  [**delete as appropriate*]

## **Context**

In order to be able to release code safely as part of a CI/CD pipeline, it is necessary to have a feature management capability to externalise the ability to enable features.

This can be achieved by including feature toggles in code, and by versioning APIs to account for breaking changes.

The options available are:

- AWS AppConfig

## **Decision**

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## **Further details**

## **Consequences**
